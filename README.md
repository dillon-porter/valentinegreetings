# Valentine Greetings
Created small JavaScript project to manipulate the DOM by grabbing the form inputs to update the Valentine Greeting Card as the user types into the text fields.

Additional updates:

I created a button to reset for form and a button to change the background color.

The button to change the background color, I fetched Scrimba's API for random colors and used a function to fetch an API and used the data from their JSON file to randomize a color and used SetProperty to change the color.
